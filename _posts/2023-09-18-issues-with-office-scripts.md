# OfficeJS

## What is OfficeJS

Released in 2014, OfficeJS is an API which marked Microsoft's shift towards a more modern, web-based approach for extending Office Applications. OfficeJS was mainly introduced as an alternative to VSTO and VBA. It had a difficult reception with the VBA community, and mostly ended up being a toold used by companies to create VSTO-like addins which could be sold in the Microsoft Office Marketplace.

## Update History

* 2024-06-01 `Excel Desktop` - Enabled script recorder.


## Issues

* Cannot use libraries - one of the key benefits of JavaScript is the library ecosystem. If you can't use libraries, there is little point in using TypeScript.
* No common datastructure libraries - it's VBA all over again!
